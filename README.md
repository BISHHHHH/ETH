README.md Token Coin This is a solidity program in which I am creating a token coin program. This program will take the input from the user and then give the total supply and the remaining balance as the output. The syntax used in this code is simple solidity syntax and uses the basic concept of the solidity program such as if-else condition, function creation, etc.

Description This is the simple code that uses solidity programming. Solidity, a programming language for creating smart contracts for the Ethereum network, this program is a straightforward contract. The program contains two functions and some variables containing two string types, one of the uint type and the last is the mapping variable. The mapping variable is mapped from the address to the uint type. And about the functions: One is the mint function which incremented the balances and the other one is the burn function which is the opposite of the mint but the burn function also contains the if condition.

Getting Start To get started with this programming type, you should first open up the solidity compiler that is Remix online IDE: https://remix.ethereum.org/. Now, when the IDE opens you first have to create a file in which you can write the code, so first click on the new file which is given at the left-hand sidebar. Name the file of your wish and save the file with an extension .sol. For example, firstcode.sol. Now, write the given code in your file


# CODE

pragma solidity 0.8.18;

contract MyCustomToken {

    // public variables here
    string public tokenName = "21BCG1086";
    string public tokenSymbol = "BISHAL";
    uint public totalSupply = 0;

    // mapping variable here
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    // mint function
    function mintTokens(address _address, uint _amount) public {
        totalSupply += _amount;
        balances[_address] += _amount;
    }

    // burn function
    function burnTokens(address _address, uint _amount) public {
        require(balances[_address] >= _amount, "Cannot burn more than balance tokens");
        totalSupply -= _amount;
        balances[_address] -= _amount;
    }
}
# EXPLAINATION:
The provided Solidity smart contract represents a custom token named "MyCustomToken" and is written using Solidity version 0.8.18. The contract includes functionality for minting and burning tokens, and it utilizes a mapping to keep track of token balances for different Ethereum addresses.

The contract starts with a pragma directive specifying the Solidity version used for compiling the contract. This ensures that the contract is compatible with the specified version.

Next, the contract defines public variables to store information about the custom token. These variables are publicly accessible, allowing anyone to query them. The `tokenName` variable is a string that represents the name of the custom token, set to "21BCG1086." The `tokenSymbol` variable is also a string and represents the symbol of the token, set to "BISHAL." The `totalSupply` variable is an unsigned integer that represents the total supply of the custom token, and it is initialized to 0. This variable will be updated whenever new tokens are minted or burned.

The contract utilizes a mapping called `balances` to keep track of the token balances of different Ethereum addresses. The mapping associates Ethereum addresses (of type `address`) with their corresponding token balances (of type `uint`). Since the mapping is declared as public, anyone can query the balance of any address using this mapping.

The contract implements two main functions for token management:

1. **Mint Function (`mintTokens`)**:
   The `mintTokens` function allows anyone to mint (create) new tokens and assign them to a specified Ethereum address. It takes two parameters: `_address`, which represents the Ethereum address to which the newly minted tokens will be assigned, and `_amount`, which is the number of tokens to be minted. When this function is called, it increments the `totalSupply` by the `_amount`, effectively creating new tokens. It also increases the balance of the `_address` by the `_amount`, reflecting the newly minted tokens in that account. This function enables the contract to create and distribute new tokens, expanding the total supply.

2. **Burn Function (`burnTokens`)**:
   The `burnTokens` function allows anyone to burn (destroy) tokens from a specified Ethereum address. It takes two parameters: `_address`, which represents the Ethereum address from which the tokens will be burned, and `_amount`, which is the number of tokens to be burned. Before burning tokens, the function checks if the balance of the `_address` is greater than or equal to the `_amount` using a `require` statement. If the condition is not met, the transaction is reverted with an error message, preventing burning more tokens than the available balance. If the balance check passes, the `burnTokens` function decreases the `totalSupply` by the `_amount`, effectively reducing the total supply of tokens. Additionally, it decreases the balance of the `_address` by the `_amount`, reflecting the burned tokens. This function provides a mechanism for reducing the token supply and removing tokens from circulation.

It's important to note that this is a basic implementation of a custom token contract and lacks several essential features such as transfer functions, event logging, access control mechanisms, and more. In a real-world scenario, additional functionalities and security measures would be necessary to ensure the token operates securely and effectively within the Ethereum ecosystem.

In practice, custom token contracts are widely used to create various assets and utilities on the Ethereum blockchain. Tokens can represent digital assets, loyalty points, governance tokens, or serve as an integral part of decentralized applications (DApps). Developers often build more complex token contracts with additional features like time-based locking, token vesting, and more advanced access controls to meet the specific requirements of their projects.

When deploying a smart contract like this on the Ethereum blockchain or any other blockchain platform, security is of utmost importance. Vulnerabilities in smart contracts can lead to serious consequences, including loss of funds or assets. As a best practice, smart contract developers should conduct thorough security audits and testing to ensure the robustness and correctness of their code. Additionally, following standard token standards such as ERC-20 (Ethereum Request for Comments 20) or other well-established token standards can enhance interoperability and usability within the broader blockchain ecosystem. Overall, smart contracts and custom tokens have significant potential to revolutionize various industries by enabling secure, transparent, and efficient digital asset management and value exchange on the blockchain.
